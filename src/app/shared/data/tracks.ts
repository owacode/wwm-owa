            In many countries around the globe, women tend to be the ones using and managing water in the home day to day. Water scarcity in developing countries like India that is already struggling to cope with rapid urbanization, economic constraints, and an insufficient water infrastructure. Involving women in major WWM projects is a common model for interventions to build confidence and overall community resilience. <br><br>
            This International Conference has separate track to support Women in Water and Waste management. We seek to serve women working in all aspects of ONE water (drinking, waste, storm, and reuse), and Solid waste and Energy sectors.
            Women in WWM’s mission is to empower women working in this industry by inviting them into a safe and comfortable environment to mentor and be mentored, develop a woman-to-woman support network, and engage in woman-centered educational and leadership development opportunities.</p>
            <h3>
            The goals of the Women in WWM sector are:
            </h3>
            <ul>
            <li> Female leadership in WWM sector</li>
            <li>	Demonstrating significant impact in the WWM sector</li>
            <li>	 Inspiring participation of women in the industry</li>
            <li>	Encouraging girl students in STEM courses and Environment careers</li>

            (Water Reuse)	Water is a critical input for agricultural production and plays an important role in food security. Irrigated agriculture represents 20% of the total cultivated land and contributes 40% of the total food produced worldwide. Irrigated agriculture is, on average, at least twice as productive per unit of land as rainfed agriculture, thereby allowing for more production intensification and crop diversification. Due to population growth, urbanization, and climate change, competition for water resources is expected to increase, with a particular impact on agriculture. Population is expected to increase to over 10 billion by 2050, and whether urban or rural, this population will need food and fiber to meet its basic needs. Combined with the increased consumption of calories and more complex foods, which accompanies income growth in the developing world, it is estimated that agricultural production will need to expand by approximately 70% by 2050. Currently, agriculture accounts (on average) for 70% of all freshwater withdrawals globally (and an even higher share of “consumptive water use” due to the evapotranspiration of crops). 
            <br><br>
            Managing these waters, including runoff and reuse of excess agricultural wastewater during surface irrigation (as well as reclaiming municipal wastewater for agricultural use), is critical for ensuring food security.

            Globally, there are more than 2.2 billion people who lack access to safely managed drinking water services and 4.2 billion people who lack safely managed sanitation services. Unsafe hygiene practices are widespread, compounding the effects on people’s health. The impact on child mortality rates is devastating with almost 300,000 children under five dying annually from diarrheal diseases due to poor sanitation, poor hygiene, or unsafe drinking water. Universal, affordable, and sustainable access to WASH is a key public health issue within international development and is the focus of the first two targets of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Targets 6.1 and 6.2 aim at equitable and accessible water and sanitation for all.
            <br><br>
            The global pandemic (COVID-19) has also exacerbated mortality rates and public safety concerns. It has also provided opportunities for some water utilities to track sources of the virus in their communities.</p>`

            Solid Waste	Currently, about 2.01 billion metric tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) are produced annually worldwide. The World Bank estimates overall waste generation will increase to 3.40 billion metric tons by 2050. An estimated 13.5% of today's waste is recycled and 5.5% is composted. The report estimates that between one-third and 40% of waste generated worldwide is not managed properly and instead dumped or openly burned. <br><br>
            Rich countries (such as the United States, Canada and members of the European Union) represent just 16% of global population, but produce 34% of the world’s waste. An estimated 93% of waste in low-income countries is mismanaged, as compared to 2% in high-income countries. <br><br>
            The concept of zero waste goes beyond recycling and composting at the end of a product's life cycle, to encompass the entire life cycle of a product, beginning with product design, and envisioning the use and management of materials in ways that preserve value, minimize environmental impacts, and conserve natural resources.	</p>`

            In the world of growing population,
            resources are becoming scarce. Therefore, reuse of resources is becoming more and more attractive. Wastewater can be used as a resource, since it contains many resources like organic matter, phosphorus, nitrogen, heavy metals, thermal energy, etc.
            There is a wide variety of possible alternatives, and the technical options are growing. The problem is not the availability of technology for resource recovery, but the lack of a planning and design methodology to identify and deploy the most sustainable solutions in a given context.

Smart water management systems include advanced water meters, meter reading technology, advanced analytics, advanced pressure management, residential water efficiency management, and SCADA systems. Increasing scarcity of water coupled with rising demand for water conservation across the world is expected to drive the digital water market growth over the next decade. Water losses through dilapidated pipes and infrastructure, dripping faucets and running toilets, and other leaks represent $2.6 billion in lost revenue for US water utilities each year, according to the U.S. EPA. Theft, unbilled/unmetered consumption, and meter inaccuracy can also lead to lost revenue.

            The global Water and Wastewater treatment market to reach USD 674.72 billion by 2025 ( Source: Hexa Research), driven by the rising demand for freshwater for drinking, industrialization and agriculture. Treated water is suitable for various end-uses such as river flow maintenance, drinking, the supply of industrial water and irrigation.
            <br><br>
            Water & wastewater treatment processes such as softening, deodorization and purification make the water more useful and potable. Asia Pacific was the largest market accounting for 43.9% of the revenue share in 2016. It is anticipated to gain momentum over the forecast period on account of the growing demand for filtered water for various applications.
            <br><br>
            Water treatment systems are either installed at the point of use or the point of entry. However, as drinking water is a vital priority for the population, the residential sector contributes significantly towards the development of water treatment market as compared to the industrial and commercial sector.
            <br><br>
            Government of India has a target to provide Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) by 2024 of the order of 146 Million, through Jal Jivan Mission. The total outlay for this project is USD 51 billion between 2019 and 2024 in 700,000 villages.
            <br><br>
            The global waste Management market is expected to reach USD 530 billion by 2025 growing at a rate of 6.0%. Increase in Environmental awareness, rapid Industrialization, surge in population, and raise in the urbanization foster the growth of global waste management market.</p>`
